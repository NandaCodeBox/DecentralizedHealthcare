# Hero Section - Final Update (Requirement-Based)

**Date**: February 6, 2026  
**Status**: ✅ LIVE - http://localhost:3000

---

## 🎯 What Changed

The hero section has been updated to reflect the **actual problem statement** from the design requirements:

**The Real Problem**: Patients don't know what care level they need (emergency, urgent, routine, or self-care). They need intelligent triage to route them to the right provider.

---

## 📋 New Hero Content

### Label
**"✓ Intelligent Care Routing"**

### Main Heading
**"Get the Right Care, Right Now"**

This is:
- ✅ Catchy and positive
- ✅ Action-oriented
- ✅ Reflects the core value proposition
- ✅ Not negative (no "confused" or "unsure")

### Subheading
**"Emergency? Urgent? Routine? We assess your symptoms and route you to the perfect care level."**

This clearly states:
- The 4 care levels we handle
- What we do (assess symptoms)
- What you get (perfect care level routing)

### Description
**"AI-powered triage verified by doctors. Connect with the right provider in minutes."**

This emphasizes:
- AI + Doctor verification (human oversight)
- Speed (minutes)
- Outcome (right provider)
