## 🎯 What Was Done

The hero section has been completely redesigned to be **sleek, user-friendly, and problem-focused** in layman's terms. The new design clearly explains the problem we solve and how we solve it.

---

## 📝 The Problem We Solve

### User's Actual Problem
> "I'm not feeling well. Do I need to see a doctor? Or can I wait? I'm confused and don't know what to do."

### Our Solution
> "Tell us your symptoms. We'll analyze them with AI and have a doctor review. Then we'll connect you with the right doctor in minutes."

## 🎨 New Hero Section

### Main Heading
**"Confused About Your Health?"**

This immediately resonates with users because it's their actual problem.

### Subheading
**"Don't know if you need a doctor or can wait it out?"**

This is the specific pain point we address.

### Description
**"We help you understand what's wrong and connect you with the right doctor in minutes."**

This clearly states:
- What we do (help understand)
- How we do it (analysis)
- What you get (right doctor)
- How fast (minutes)

### 3-Step Process
1. **Tell Us** - Your symptoms
2. **We Analyze** - AI + Doctor review
3. **Get Help** - Right doctor, fast

This shows users exactly what happens.

### Call-to-Action Buttons
- **Primary**: "Tell Us Your Symptoms" (Blue)
- **Secondary**: "Emergency Help Now" (Red)

Clear, specific actions.
